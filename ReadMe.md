This project was made by myself right after finishing high school, before starting my studies in UNESP. 
I delevoped this autonomous vehicule inspired on my garage cleaning problem. There were many trees nearby, so the garage was always full of leaves all the time. 
It was intended to implement a vaccum cleaner on it to eliminate this cleaning routine.
Not many years later, the autonomous vaccum cleaner has been released on the market.
Later, during a conversation with a professor at UNESP, I realized I was using Fuzzy programming logic.
This project allowed me to be introduced to C programming language, programming logics, electronics, micro controller (Arduino) and project management.
